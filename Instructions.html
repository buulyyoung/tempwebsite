     <br>
		<li>Crack 6 eggs in a mixing bowl. Use a fork or a whisk to stir the eggs. Do not beat the eggs or over-stir; just stir enough to homogenize the whites and yolks. The tip of the whisk should always be touching the bottom of the bowl. This is to avoid creating foam.</li>

		<li>Place the cake pan right in the middle of the oven. Bake at 175째C/ 350째F for about 45 minutes, until golden. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick in the center of a cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.</li>

		<li>Let the cake cool upside down on a rack. The cake tastes the best freshly out of the oven. It can be stored for 1-2 days by wrapping in plastic wrap. If you serve it on the next day, microwave for about 15 seconds.</li>
